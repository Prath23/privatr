Works like object detection
first creates/takes a static image when run which is used as the refrence frame
Now from the camera we take input and each frame is compared with the intial refrence frame
Diffrence from the frames is detected using filters and convolution
Every movement that will be done in the frame is detected and rectangel box is drawn aroud it to show it visualy
